## 📊 Workflow Summary

The ML pipeline consists of the following key steps:

1. **Data Preparation**  
   - 80/20 train-test split on the original dataset  
   - Data preprocessing and MICE-imputation

2. **Model Training**  
   - 10-fold cross-validation on the training set  
   - Models: Logistic Regression (LR), Composite Regression (CR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (XGBoost), Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN).

3. **Model Application and Evaluation**  
   - Trained models are applied to the test set  
   - Scoring includes accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Training vs Validation Loss, Training vs. Validation Accuracy, AUC-ROC
  
## 📌 Reproducibility

To reproduce the results:

### Create environment

`conda create -n ml-pipeline python=3.9 -y`  
`conda activate ml-pipeline`  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Run training
``python src/training.py``

### Run evaluation
``python src/evaluation.py``
